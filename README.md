# Java-Servlet-on-Apache-Tomcat
## Implement and Deploy a Java Sevlet on Apache Tomcat 


What the application does: <br />
With an html containing the link to my servlet, we can open on any browser a webpage that's gonna show "Bonjour *First Name* *Last Name*" <br />
<br />
The technologies I used: <br />
- Intellij IDEA 2022.3.2 (Ultimate edition) 
- Apache Tomcat version 10 

Some of the challenges I faced and features I hope to implement in the future:
- Had difficulties implementing this application with intellij community edition 
- I hope to implement a webpage simulating an authentification service (usernaame and password verifications)
